```bash
# Run the following command from root dir to be able to execute python files as scripts.
find ./ -type f -iname "*.py" -exec chmod +x {} \;

# Run following command to create artefacts for a particular day (42 in this case).
# Artefacts created are {day}.py, testinput{day}.txt, input{day}.txt
 ./scripts/createartefacts.sh -d=42
